        <h3>computer stuff</h3>

        <p>This is the computer that we( Me and my family )opened up:</p>

        <div class="imageHolder">
            <img class="covidPictures" src="resources/images/insideofdesktop.jpg"/>
            <p>

                This is the inside of a desktop computer. It has lots of electrical components. For example,
                there is the motherboard (the motherboard is completely green, big ,and thin). You can see the cooling system
                it is in a big black box, that has some wires, a fan, and the heat sink (some copper pips).
                The heat sink draws the heat away from the hot components and the heat travels through copper tubes in
                the heat sink and towards the fan that pulls the hot air out of the computer (you mite not understand
                this, the first time you read it).
            <p/>
        </div>

        <div class="imageHolder">
            <img class="covidPictures" src="resources/images/harddrivethatshouldbeused.jpeg"/>
            <p>
                This is a picture of the components inside a hard drive.
                Inside of a hard drive, there are three strong magnets, that are super strong and fragile.
                There is a small disk to store the data on, that has a mirror shine.
                Depending on the computer that you take the hard drive out of you can get more or less
                hard drives.The hard drive is the shiny disc.
            </p>

        <div class="imageHolder">
            <img class="covidPictures" src="resources/images/Picofinsideofacomputerscreen.jpg"/>
            <p>
                This is a picture of what is inside a computer screen. When you take apart a computer screen, there are a lot
                of layers.  There is the fresnel layers and the diffusion layers. The two middle layers ( the fresnel layers)
                have a mirror and rainbow effect.

            <p>
                These are  examples of the rainbow/mirror effect that the fresnel layers have.

        <h3>sewing</h3>
        <div class="imageHolder">
            <img  class="covidPictures"src="resources/images/bigpoketpoutch.jpg"/>

       <p>
           This is a picture of a bed side hanging pouch with two pockets, it is around 1 1/2 feet in width and
           1 foot in height.It was a bit tricky because,  I do not sew that often, my siblings and I were doing the same design,
           and because there were a lot of steps to that project.
           now I am working on pj pants,(when it`s done I will post it).

        <h3>cooking</h3>
        <br class="imageHolder">
            <img class="covidPictures" src="resources/images/makaroons.jpg"/>
            <p>
                This is a picture of chocolate covered Macaroons. I know that in the picture there are only ten.
                The batch made out around 20 Macaroons, and my family and I ate the rest of them. They were amazing!
                Here is the recipe:
            </p>
            Ingredients
            <ul>
                <li>  2 1/2 cups dried unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
                <li>  1 1/2 tbsp potato starch</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>4 large egg whites</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla (optional)</li>
                <li> 13 oz dark chocolate, divided</li>
            </ul>
                <span style='font-size:50px;'>&#128563;</span>
        <br>

          step1) In a large mixing bowl, use fork to stir together the shredded coconut, potato starch,
            sugar and salt till well blended. Break up any chunks of potato starch.
            </br>
            </br>
          step2)  In a smaller bowl, whisk together the egg whites and vanilla till frothy
            (bubbles covering the mixture)
            </br>
            </br>
         step3) Pour egg white mixture into dried coconut mixture. Stir batter together,
            making sure the coconut is fully and evenly moistened by egg whites. Stir for 5 minutes.
            Let mixture sit for 20-30 minutes while the coconut rehydrate's.
            </br>
            </br>
         step4) Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Stir batter again. Line baking sheet with parchment paper
            or with a Silpat. Start forming the macaroons. They won't spread, so you can bake them close
            together.
            </br>
            </br>
         step5) The batter will be delicate, it won't "hold" together the way cookie dough does, as they bake
            they'll stick together. When you've dropped all of the batter onto your baking sheets,
            use wet fingers to gently shape the macaroons into rough domes or haystacks. Don't worry, they're not
            supposed to be perfect.
            </br>
            </br>
         step6) Bake the macaroons for 20-25 minutes till the bottom edges turn golden and the tips of the coconut
            shreds start to brown. Remove from the oven. Don't over-bake or they will become dry. If by the end of the
            25 minutes the macaroons are not solid, then continue to bake them for another 15 minutes,
            but make sure that they dont OVER COOK.
            </br>
            </br>
        step7) Let the macaroons cool, before moving them. Trying to move them too soon
           will cause them to crumble.
            </br>
        step8) When the macaroons have cooled completely, you can dip and decorate them to your wish.
        If wanted use a piping bag, if you dont have one just use a zip loc bag and cut a small hole on one
        corner.
