        <h2> Things I have done during Corona time...</h2>
        <h3>computer stuff</h3>

        <p>This is the computer that we(Me and my family)opened up:</p>

        <div class="imageHolder">
            <img class="covidPictures" src="resources/images/insideofdesktop.jpg"/>
            <p>

                This is the inside of a desktop computer. It has lots of electrical components. For example,
                there is the motherboard (the motherboard is completely green, big ,and thin). You can see the cooling system
                it is in a big black box, that has some wires and a fan attached to it so that it can cool down the computer.
                The cooling system is just one big fan that is there to cool down the computer when ever it gets hot.
                Now you are probably wondering where the air goes, well the air goes out of the computer using two copper air
                pipes. Then to the bottom left, there is the hard drive which looks like this.
            <p/>

        <div class="imageHolder">
            <img class="covidPictures" src="resources/images/harddrivethatshouldbeused.jpeg"/>
            <p>
                This is a picture of the components inside a hard drive.
                Inside of a hard drive, there are three strong magnets, that are super strong and fragile.
                There is a small disk to store the data on that has a mirror shine.
                Depending on the computer that you take the hard drive out of you can get more or less
                hard drives.

        <div class="imageHolder">

            <p>
                This is a picture of what is inside a computer screen. When you take apart a computer screen, there are a lot
                of layers.  There is the fresnel layers and the diffusion layers. The two middle layers ( the fresnel layers)
                have a mirror and rainbow effect.
            </p>

        <div class="imageHolder">
            <img class="covidPictures" src="resources/images/picofsisterholdingfenallayer.jpg"/>
            <img class="covidPictures" src="resources/images/anotherexampleofthefresnelleyer.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Thees are  examples of the rainbow/mirror effect that the fresnel layers have.
